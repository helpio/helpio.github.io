				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					These guidelines are for law enforcement officials seeking information about Helpio user accounts. When Helpio receives a request for user account information from a government agency investigating criminal activity, the Helpio team reviews each request to be sure that it satisfies all legal requirements. Helpio is committed to cooperating with law enforcement while respecting each individual’s right to privacy.
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					What is Helpio?
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Helpio is a social networking application that is based on map and location. It lets users discover what is happening around them. The app helps connecting users to users around them so they can share news, thoughts, helps and ask questions. Helpio is bridging the communication gap between people that are in the same location.
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					What Account Information Does Helpio Have?
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Helpio records a user’s IP address at the time of the app’s installation. In addition, Helpio maintains a log of the following information for each message posted:
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>The IP address from which the message was posted;</li>
					<li>The GPS coordinates of the location from which the message was posted;</li>
					<li>The time and date when the message was posted; and</li>
					<li>The user-agent string associated with the device from which the message was posted</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Helpio will also require its users to provide a phone number when posting content to the app or if Helpio suspects improper activity.
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					Data Retention and Preservation Requests
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Helpio retains different types of information for different time periods. Due to the real-time nature of Helpio, some information may be stored for only a very brief period of time.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Helpio will not retain data for law enforcement unless it receives a valid preservation request. Preservation requests must be submitted in writing, on official law enforcement letterhead, and signed by the requesting official. Please include screenshots of the messages that you wish to be preserved, if available. Requests may be sent as an email attachment (our contact information is below).
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					Legal Process Requirements
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Helpio discloses user account information only in accordance with applicable law, <span class="text-red">including the federal Stored Communications Act (“SCA”), 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq.</span> Helpio will only release non-public information about its users to law enforcement officials in response to appropriate legal process, such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant – or in response to a valid emergency request, as described below. Under the SCA:
				</div>
				<ul class="text-red">
					<li>A valid administrative, grand jury, or trial subpoena in connection with an official criminal investigation or prosecution is required to compel Helpio to disclose certain specific types of “basic subscriber information” (defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2)). Helpio’s records of “basic subscriber information,” that can be disclosed in response to an appropriate subpoena will generally be limited to (1) the telephone number provided by the user, (2) the user’s IP address at the time of installation, and (3) the time and date when the user installed the app.</li>
					<li>A court order issued under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) is required to compel Helpio to disclose certain non-content records associated with a user’s account. This could include (1) the time and date when a message was posted, (2) the IP address associated with a specific message, (3) the GPS location from which the message was posted, and (4) the user-agent string associated with the device from which the message was posted.</li>
					<li>A search warrant is required to compel Helpio to disclose the contents of any messages associated with a user’s account. In addition, the SCA permits Helpio to disclose the non-content records described above in response to a search warrant.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Any legal process submitted to Helpio should include a detailed description of the specific Helpio post(s) that you are seeking information about, including the exact language of the post, and if known, the approximate time, date, and location of the post. Please provide screenshots of the posts if available.
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					Emergency Requests
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="text-red">Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2702(b)(8) and 2702(c)(4)</span>, Helpio may disclose user account information to law enforcement – without a subpoena, court order, or search warrant – in response to a valid emergency when we believe that doing so is necessary to prevent death or serious physical harm to someone (for instance, in cases involving kidnapping, bomb threats, school shootings, or suicide threats). Helpio evaluates emergency requests on a case-by-case basis.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Any information Helpio provides in response to emergency requests is limited to what we believe would prevent the harm. This may include a user’s IP address, GPS coordinates, message timestamps, telephone number, user-agent string, and/or the contents of other messages from the user’s posting history.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Law enforcement officers can submit an emergency request as an email attachment (our contact information is below). Emergency requests must be submitted on law enforcement letterhead, and must include the following:
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>a detailed description of the emergency;</li>
					<li>a description of the harm to be prevented;</li>
					<li>a detailed description of the Helpio post that you are seeking information about, including screenshots, if available;</li>
					<li>the specific information requested, including an explanation of why that information is necessary to prevent the harm;</li>
					<li>an explanation of why the information is needed without waiting for legal process</li>
					<li>and the signature of the submitting law enforcement officer</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Please note that Helpio cannot review or respond to emergency requests sent by non-law enforcement officials. If you are aware of an emergency situation, you should immediately contact your local law enforcement officials.
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					Will Helpio Notify Users About Law Enforcement Requests?
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Helpio reserves the right to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to notify users about law enforcement requests, unless Helpio receives a valid order precluding such notice pursuant to <span class="text-red">18 U.S.C. § 2705.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="h3">
					Contact Information
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Law enforcement officials may submit requests by mail or email to:
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="text-grey">address here</span>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					<span class="text-grey">Email: legal@helpiotech.com</span>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Please Note: <span class="text-grey">legal@helpiotech.com</span> is for law enforcement officials ONLY! Users wishing to have a post removed should email <span class="text-grey">support@helpiotech.com.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Receipt of correspondence by any of these means is for convenience only and does not waive any objections, including the lack of jurisdiction or proper service. Helpio will not respond to requests for user information sent by non-law enforcement officials.
